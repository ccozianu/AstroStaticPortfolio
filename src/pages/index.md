    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my digital garden. I'm a passionate developer who loves turning coffee into code. 
        When I'm not debugging, you can find me exploring the retro web, reading sci-fi, or tinkering with new tech.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe in clean code, open source, and the power of the web to connect people.
